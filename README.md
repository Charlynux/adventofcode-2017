# Advent of Code 2017

The best way to learn code is by coding. It's even better when you could compare your code with experts' one.

For this, Advent of Code is ideal. I could solve problems, then check other solutions to discover new patterns/functions.

If you search good code examples, you are in the wrong place.
I don't intend to change my "straight forward" solutions. When I found a better way to solve problem, I just try to apply in the next days' problems.

I recommend those repositories for better solutions :
